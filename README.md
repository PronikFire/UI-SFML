This is my little library for creating an interface in SFML.
I am aware that such libraries already exist, but they either did not work for me or did not suit me. So I decided to make my own. 
I'm going to periodically finish and support it, but I don't promise anything

If you suddenly decide that my code is shit, I do not blame. I'm not a pro)
